I am a robotics researcher and life-long learner. I obtained Ph. D. degree in human informatics from University of Tsukuba in March 2023 and currently working as a post-doc at EPFL, supervised by Prof. Dario Floreano. I was a post-doc at University of Tsukuba from April 2024 to March 2025, a visiting post-doc at ETH Zurich from June 2023 to December 2023 and a research fellow (PD) of Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) from April 2023 to March 2024. My research interests include but are not limited to aerial robotics, human augmentation, human-robot interaction, teleoperation, shared control, assistive technology, etc.  
Research goal: Use robotics technology to empower humans.
